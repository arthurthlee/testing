          ## Summary of Changes

          ### Files Modified:
          - `src/requirements.txt` - Updated dependencies
          - `app.py` - Fixed validation logic
          - `tests/test_app.py` - Added new test cases

          ### Key Changes:
          1. **Dependencies Update**: Updated package requirements to resolve compatibility issues
          2. **Validation Fix**: Fixed input validation that was causing errors with special characters
          3. **Test Coverage**: Added comprehensive test cases for edge cases

          ### Technical Details:
          - Replaced deprecated `old_function()` with `new_function()`
          - Added proper error handling for network timeouts
          - Implemented input sanitization for user data

          This fix addresses the core issue while maintaining backward compatibility.

          ## Summary of Changes

          ### Files Modified:
          - `README.md` - Added mock fix section

          ### Key Changes:
          1. **Mock Testing**: Added test content to verify GitHub Actions workflow
          2. **Issue Reference**: Included issue number and title in the changes
          3. **Timestamp**: Added generation timestamp for tracking

          ### Technical Details:
          - This is a simulated fix for testing purposes
          - The changes demonstrate the workflow functionality
          - Real SWE-agent would analyze the actual issue and generate appropriate fixes

          This mock fix verifies the GitHub Actions integration works correctly.
